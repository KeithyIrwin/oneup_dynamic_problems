Top Level Directories
=====================
problems
    - dynamic problems which only use Lua code (contained or 
      from libraries) but don't involve any outside files
programming_problems
    - problems which rely on the programinterface.lua library 
      to run code in other languages
libraries
    - any code which contains useful functions which might be able
      to be used in the several different problems.  Some code from
      existing problems should be copied or relocated here

Organization
============

problems and programming_problems
    - Top directory: course
    - Inside directory: topic or type of material covered by the problem
    - Each problem should then have its own directory
        - Should contain:
	  - The set-up code for the problem
	     - setup.lua
          - The template code for the problem
             - template.txt
                 * If no rich text is needed, use .txt
             - template.rtf or template.odt
	         * If rich text is needed
             - template_1.*, template_2.*
                 * If problem has multiple parts
          - Additional information about the problem or the code which
             isn't vital, but could be informative, if such exists.
             This is also where discussion should usually go.
             - comments.txt

libraries
    - Top directory: course or subject matter
    - Subdirectories usually won't be needed, but can be used if appropriate
    - Files should be .lua files
